# Zephyr Workshop

Welcome to this Zephyr Workshop! This workshop is designed for everyone who is
new to Zephyr. This repository includes slides firmware samples and a modular
application. It links to existing references on how to get started and explains
basic RTOS concepts with examples.

Resources to quickly get started with Zephyr:

- [Zephyr Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/)
- [Supported Boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/)
- [Samples and Demos](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/)
- [Zephyr GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr)

## Slides ðŸ“Š

The slides can be downloaded as pdf file under the releases. They explain
Zephyr fundamentals and how to get started with the hands-on part of the
workshop.

The presentation slides are written with Latex Beamer and the
[mtheme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme/tree/master). To build the
presentation and generate a PDF file, execute `make`.

### Samples

There are several samples in the folder `samples`. These samples are mostly
adapted from the [Zephyr GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) and referenced here
for a better overview. All samples can be built as Zephyr workspace examples.

### Modular Application
The modular application is a simple example of a modular application that
consists of multiple modules. Different modules communicate with each oter via
Zephyr's Zbus. The application is located at Â´appÂ´, related tests are in the
Â´testsÂ´ folder.

The application should run on most supported boards as it only uses a button
and an led. However, if you do not have a hardware available, you can run the
application with Renode. The Renode configuration is located in the `utils`
folder. For running the application in Renode, you have to build for the
`stm32f4_disco` board.

You can build the application as follows:
```shell
west build -b stm32f4_disco app -p
```

And run in Renode:
```shell
renode util/stm32f4.resc --disable-gui --console
```

To run and explore integration tests with twister, you can build the tests and
application for mulitple boards:
```shell
west twister -T app/ -T test/ --integration
```

## Local Environment

### Setup the with existing Zephyr Project Workspace

After completing the Zephyr Getting Started guide, you should already have a
project folder setup. In this case, you can just clone this repository into the
existing `zephyrproject` folder:

```shell
# clone this repository in the existing zephyrproject folder
cd zephyrproject
git clone https://github.com/jonas-rem/zephyr-workshop
# Change west config manifest file location to the zephyr-workshop repository
west config manifest.path zephyr-workshop
# update Zephyr modules
west update
```

### Setup from Scratch

To set up a new Zephyr workspace directly from this repository, west can be
used with the following options:

```shell
# Initialize a workspace named zephyrproject from this repository.
west init -m https://github.com/jonas-rem/zephyr-workshop --mr main zephyrproject
# update Zephyr modules
cd zephyrproject
west update
```

### Building and running of the Firmware Samples

```shell
# e.g. for reel_board
west build -b reel_board samples/01_hello_world -p

# Or for a simulation that can run on the host system
west build -b qemu_cortex_m0 samples/01_hello_world -p
```

Once the sample is build, run the following command to flash/run it:

```shell
# on a board
west flash

# qemu simulation
west build -t run
```
